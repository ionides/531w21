\section{Stationary causal linear processes}

\begin{frame}[fragile]

\frametitle{Definition: Stationary causal linear process}

\bi
\item A \myemph{stationary causal linear process} is a time series models that can be written as

\eqvspace

\negListSpace [M7] $\eqspace Y_n = \mu + g_0\epsilon_n + g_1\epsilon_{n-1}+g_2\epsilon_{n-2}+g_3\epsilon_{n-3} + g_4\epsilon_{n-4}+\dots$

\eqvspace

where $\{\epsilon_n, n=\dots,-2,-1,0,1,2,\dots\}$ is a white noise process, defined for all integer timepoints, with variance $\myvar(\epsilon_n)=\sigma^2$.

\item We do not need to define any initial values. The doubly infinite noise process $\{\epsilon_n, n=\dots,-2,-1,0,1,2,\dots\}$ is enough to define $Y_n$ for every $n$ as long as the infinite sum in [M7] converges.

\ei

\vspace{2mm}

\myquestion. When does ``stationary'' here mean weak stationarity, and when does it mean strict stationary? 

\answer{\vspace{30mm}}{todo}

\end{frame}   

\begin{frame}[fragile]

\bi

\item \myemph{causal} in [M7] refers to $\{\epsilon_n\}$ being a causal driver of $\{Y_n\}$. The value of $Y_n$ depends only on noise process values already determined by time $n$.

\item This matching a requirement that causes must precede effects
(\url{wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradford_Hill_criteria}). 

\item \myemph{linear} refers to linearity of $Y_n$ as a function of $\{\epsilon_n\}$. 


\ei

\end{frame}

\subsection{The autocovariance of a linear process}

\begin{frame}[fragile]

\frametitle{The autocovariance function for a linear process}

\vspace{-4mm}

\begin{eqnarray}
\gamma_h &=& \cov\big(Y_n,Y_{n+h}\big)\\
&=& \cov\left(\sum_{j=0}^\infty g_j\epsilon_{n-j},\sum_{k=0}^\infty g_k\epsilon_{n+h-k}\right)\\
&=& \sum_{j=0}^\infty \sum_{k=0}^\infty  g_j g_k\cov\big(\epsilon_{n-j},\epsilon_{n+h-k}\big)\\
&=& \sum_{j=0}^\infty g_jg_{j+h} \sigma^2, \mbox{for $h\ge 0$}.
\label{eq:linear:autocovariance}
\end{eqnarray}


\vspace{-1mm}

\bi

\item For the autocovariance function to be finite, we need
\begin{equation}
\sum_{j=0}^\infty g_j^2 < \infty.
\end{equation}

\item We assumed we can move $\sum_{j=0}^\infty \sum_{k=0}^\infty$ through $\cov$, discussed below.

\ei

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]

\bi

\item The interchange of expectation and infinite sums cannot be taken for granted. 
$\cov\left(\sum_{i=1}^m X_i,\sum_{j=1}^n Y_j\right)=\sum_{i=1}^m\sum_{j=1}^n \cov(X_i,Y_j)$ is true for finite $m$ and $n$, but not necessarily for infinite sums.

\item In this course, we do not focus on interchange issues, but we try to notice when we make assumptions.
      
\item The interchange of $\sum_{0}^\infty$ and $\cov$ can be justified by requiring a stronger condition,
\begin{equation}
\sum_{j=0}^\infty |g_j| < \infty.
\end{equation}

\item The MA(q) model that we defined in equation M3 is an example of a stationary, causal linear process.

\item The general stationary, causal linear process model, M7, can also be called the MA($\infty$) model.

\subsection{Causal and non-causal AR(1) models}

 \begin{frame}[fragile]

\frametitle{A stationary causal linear solution to the AR(1) model, and a non-causal solution}

\eqvspace

[M8] \hspace{2mm} $\eqspace Y_n = \ar Y_{n-1}+\epsilon_n$.

\eqvspace
    
This has a causal solution,
    
\eqvspace

[M8.1] $\eqspace Y_n = \sum_{j=0}^\infty \ar^j\epsilon_{n-j}$.

It also has a non-causal solution,
    
\vspace{2mm}

[M8.2] $\eqspace Y_n = \sum_{j=0}^\infty \ar^{-j}\epsilon_{n+j}$.
    
\vspace{2mm}

\myquestion. Work through the algebra to check that M8.1 and M8.2 both solve equation M8.

\end{frame}   

\begin{frame}[fragile]

\frametitle{Convergence of the infinite sums in M8.1 and M8.2}

\myquestion. For what values of $\ar$ is the causal solution M8.1 a convergent infinite sum, meaning that it converges to a random variable with finite variance? For what values is the non-causal solution M8.2 a convergent infinite sum?

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Using the MA($\infty$) representation to compute the autocovariance of an ARMA model}

\myquestion. The linear process representation can be a convenient way to calculate autocovariance functions. Use the linear process representation in M8.1, together with our expression for the autocovariance of the general linear process M7 in equation~\ref{eq:linear:autocovariance}, to get an expression for the autocovariance function of the AR(1) model.

\section{ARMA models written using the backshift operator}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{The backshift operator and the difference operator}

\bi
\item The \myemph{backshift} operator $B$, also known as the \myemph{lag} operator, is given by
\begin{equation}
B Y_n = Y_{n-1}.
\end{equation}

\item The \myemph{difference} operator $\Delta=1-B$ is
\begin{equation}
\Delta Y_n = (1-B)Y_n = Y_n - Y_{n-1}.
\end{equation}

\item Powers of the backshift operator correspond to different time shifts, e.g.,
\begin{equation}
B^2 Y_n = B (BY_n) = B(Y_{n-1}) = Y_{n-2}.
\end{equation}

\item We can also take a second difference,
\begin{eqnarray} \nonumber
\Delta^2 Y_n &=& (1-B)(1-B) Y_n\\
&=& (1-2B+B^2) Y_n = Y_n - 2Y_{n-1} + Y_{n-2}.
\end{eqnarray}
 
\item The backshift operator is linear, i.e.,  
\begin{equation}
B(\alpha X_n + \beta Y_n) = \alpha BX_n +\beta BY_n = \alpha X_{n-1} +\beta Y_{n-1}
\end{equation}
\ei

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}[fragile]

\bi
\item Backshift operators and their powers can be added, multiplied by each other, and multiplied by a scalar. 

\item Mathematically, backshift operators follow the same rules as the algebra of polynomial functions. 

\item For example, a distributive rule for $\alpha+\beta B$ is
\begin{equation}
\negListSpace (\alpha +\beta B)Y_n = (\alpha B^0 +\beta B^1)Y_n = \alpha Y_n + \beta BY_n = \alpha Y_n + \beta Y_{n-1}.
\end{equation}

\item Mathematical properties we know about polynomials can be used to work with backshift operators.  

\item The AR, MA and linear process model equations can all be written in terms of polynomials in the backshift operator.

\item Write $\ar(x)= 1-\ar_1 x -\ar_2 x^2 -\dots -\ar_p x^p$,  an order $p$ polynomial,
The equation M1 for the AR(p) model can be rearranged to give
\begin{equation}
 Y_n - \ar_1 Y_{n-1}- \ar_2Y_{n-2}-\dots-\ar_pY_{n-p} = \epsilon_n,
\end{equation}
which can be written using the backshift operator as

\eqvspace
    
\negListSpace [M1$^\prime$] $\hspace{18mm} \ar(B) Y_n = \epsilon_n$.
    
\ei

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]

\bi

\item Write $\ma(x)$ for a polynomial of order $q$,
\begin{equation}\ma(x) = 1+\ma_1 x +\ma_2 x^2 + \dots +\ma_q x^q.
\end{equation}
\item 
The MA(q) equation M3 is equivalent to 

\eqvspace

\negListSpace [M3$^\prime$] $\hspace{18mm} Y_n = \ma(B) \epsilon_n$.
    
\eqvspace

\item If $g(x)$ is a function defined by the \link{https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series}{Taylor series}
\begin{equation}
g(x)= g_0 + g_1 x + g_2 x^2 + g_3 x^3 + g_4 x^4 + \dots,
\end{equation}
we can write the stationary causal linear process equation [M7] as

\eqvspace

\negListSpace [M7$^\prime$] $\hspace{18mm} Y_n = \mu + g(B)\epsilon_n$.

\eqvspace

\item Whatever you know or learn about working with Taylor series expansions helps you understand AR, MA and ARMA models.

\ei

\end{frame} 



\subsection{The general ARMA model}

\begin{frame}[fragile]

\frametitle{The general ARMA model}

\bi
\item Putting together M1 and M3 suggests an \myemph{autoregressive moving average} ARMA(p,q) model given by

\eqvspace

\hspace{-10mm} [M9] $\hspace{1mm} Y_n = \ar_1 Y_{n-1}+\ar_2Y_{n-2}+\dots+\ar_pY_{n-p} + \epsilon_n +\ma_1 \epsilon_{n-1} +\dots+\ma_q\epsilon_{n-q}$,

\eqvspace

where $\{\epsilon_n\}$ is a white noise process. Using the backshift operator, we can write this more succinctly as

\eqvspace

\negListSpace [M9$^\prime$] $\hspace{18mm} \ar(B) Y_n = \ma(B) \epsilon_n$.
    
\eqvspace

\item Experience with data analysis suggests that models with both AR and MA components often fit data better than a pure AR or MA process.

\item The general stationary ARMA(p,q) also has a mean $\mu$ so we get

\eqvspace

\negListSpace [M9$^{\prime\prime}$] $\hspace{15mm} \ar(B) (Y_n-\mu) = \ma(B) \epsilon_n$.

\eqvspace

\ei

\end{frame}   


\begin{frame}{Obtaining the MA($\infty$) representation and autocovariance of the ARMA(1,1) model, $Y_n = \ar Y_{n-1} + \epsilon_n + \ma \epsilon_{n-1}.$}


{\bf Step 1. Put the model in the form $Y_n = g(B) \epsilon_n$}.

Formally, we can write 
\begin{equation}   (1-\ar B)Y_n = (1+\ma B)\epsilon_n,
\end{equation}
which algebraically is equivalent to 
\begin{equation}
Y_n = \left(\frac{1+\ma B}{1-\ar B}\right)\epsilon_n.
\end{equation}
We can write this as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:step1}
Y_n = g(B) \epsilon_n,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
g(x) = \left(\frac{1+\ma x}{1-\ar x}\right).
\end{equation}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]

{\bf Step 2.  Work out the Taylor series expansion},
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:step2}
g(x) = g_0 + g_1 x + g_2 x^2 + g_3 x^3 + \dots
\end{equation}
You can do this either by hand or using your favorite math software. 

\vspace{3mm}

{\bf Step 3. Obtain the MA($\infty$) representation}, by putting (\ref{eq:step2}) into (\ref{eq:step1}).

\vspace{3mm}

{\bf Step 4. Obtain the autocovariance function}, by using the general formula for an MA($\infty$) process.

\vspace{5mm}

Carrying out this calculation is an exercise.

\end{frame} 


\subsection{Causal, invertible ARMA models}

  \begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Causal, invertible ARMA models}

\bi

\item We say that the ARMA model [M9] is \myemph{causal} if its MA($\infty$) representation is a convergent series. 

\item Recall that \myemph{causality} is about writing $Y_n$ in terms of the driving noise process $\{\epsilon_n,\epsilon_{n-1},\epsilon_{n-2},\dots\}$.

\item \myemph{Invertibility} is about writing $\epsilon_n$ in terms of $\{Y_n, Y_{n-1}, Y_{n-2},\dots\}$. 

\item To assess causality, we consider the convergence of the Taylor series expansion of $\ma(x)/\ar(x)$ in the ARMA representation
$$ Y_n = \frac{\ma(B)}{\ar(B)} \epsilon_n.$$

\item To assess invertibility, we consider the convergence of the Taylor series expansion of $\ar(x)/\ma(x)$ in the inversion of the ARMA model given by
$$ \epsilon_n = \frac{\ar(B)}{\ma(B)} Y_n.$$


\ei

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\bi
\item Fortunately, there is a simple way to check causality and invertibility without calculating the Taylor series.

 \item The ARMA model is causal if the AR polynomial,
$$ \ar(x) = 1-\ar_1 x - \ar_2 x^2 - \dots - \ar_p x^p$$
has all its roots (i.e., solutions to $\ar(x)=0$) outside the unit circle in the complex plane. 

 \item The ARMA model is invertible if the MA polynomial,
$$ \ma(x) = 1+\ma_1 x + \ma_2 x^2 + \dots + \ma_q x^q$$
has all its roots outside the unit circle.

\item We can check the roots using the `polyroot` function in R. For example, consider the MA(2) model,
$ Y_n = \epsilon_n + 2\epsilon_{n-1} + 2\epsilon_{n-2}$.
The roots to $\ma(x)= 1+2x+2x^2$ are

\ei

<< root>>=
roots <- polyroot(c(1,2,2))

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]

\bi

\item Finding the absolute value shows that we have two roots inside the unit circle, so this MA(2) model is not invertible.

\item In this case, you should be able to find the roots algebraically. In general, numerical evaluation of roots is useful.

%\begin{frame}[fragile]

\myquestion. It is undesirable to use a non-invertible model for data analysis. Why?
Hint: One answer to this question involves diagnosing model misspecification.

\answer{\vspace{30mm}}{todo}

\end{frame}   


\subsection{Reducible and irreducible ARMA models}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Reducible and irreducible ARMA models}

\bi
\item We have seen the ARMA model written as a ratio of two polynomials,

\begin{equation}
Y_n = \frac{\ar(B)}{\ma(B)} \epsilon_n.
\end{equation}

\item If the two polynomials $\ar(x)$ and $\ma(x)$ share a common factor, it can be canceled out without changing the model. 

\item The \myemph{fundamental theorem of algebra} says that every polynomial $\ar(x) = 1-\ar_1 x - \dots - \ar_p x^p$ of degree $p$ can be written in the form
\begin{equation}
(1-x/\lambda_1) \times (1-x/\lambda_2) \times \dots \times (1-x/\lambda_p),
\end{equation}
where $\lambda_{1:p}$ are the $p$ roots of the polynomial, which may be real or complex valued.

 \item The Taylor series expansion of $\ar(B)^{-1}$ is convergent if and only if $(1-B/\lambda_i)^{-1}$ has a convergent expansion for each $i\in 1:p$. This happens if $|\lambda_i|>1$ for each $i$.

\ei

\end{frame}
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\bi

\item The polynomials $\ar(x)$ and $\ma(x)$ share a common factor if, and only if, they share a common root. 

\item It is not clear, just from looking at the model equations, that
\begin{equation} \textstyle
Y_n = \frac{5}{6} Y_{n-1} -  \frac{1}{6} Y_{n-2} + \epsilon_n- \epsilon_{n-1}+\frac{1}{4} \epsilon_{n-2}
\end{equation}
is \myemph{exactly the same model} as
\begin{equation} \textstyle
Y_n = \frac{1}{3} Y_{n-1} + \epsilon_n- \frac{1}{2}\epsilon_{n-1}.
\end{equation}

\item To see this, you have to do the math! We see that the second of these equations is derived from the first by canceling out the common factor $(1-0.5B)$ in the ARMA model specification.

\section{AR(2) models and oscillating behavior}

\subsection{The deterministic skeleton of an ARMA model}

  \begin{frame}[fragile]{The deterministic skeleton: Using differential equation to study ARMA models}


\bi
\item Non-random physical processes evolving through time have been modeled using differential equations ever since the ground-breaking work by \citet{newton1687}.

\item We have to attend to the considerable amount of randomness (unpredictability) present in data and systems we want to study. 

\item However, it is helpful to study a related deterministic systems.

\item The \myemph{deterministic skeleton} of a time series model is the non-random process obtained by removing randomness from a stochastic model. 

\item For a discrete-time model, we can define a continuous-time deterministic skeleton by replacing the discrete-time difference equation with a differential equation.

\item Rather than deriving a deterministic skeleton from a stochastic time series model, we can instead add stochasticity to a deterministic model to get a model that can explain non-deterministic phenomena.

\ei

\end{frame}

\subsection{A second order linear differential equation for the AR(2) model}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Example: Oscillatory behavior modeled using an AR(2) process}

\bi

\item In physics, a basic model for processes that oscillate (springs, pendulums, vibrating machine parts, etc) is simple harmonic motion. 

\item The differential equation for a simple harmonic motion process $x(t)$ is

\eqvspace
  
\negListSpace [M10] $\hspace{18mm} \displaystyle \frac{d^2}{dt^2} x(t) = -\omega^2 x(t)$.

\eqvspace

\item This is a second order linear differential equation with constant coefficients.
Such equations have a closed form solution.
You may already know that the solution to M10 is \myemph{sinusoidal}. 

\item Finding the solution to a linear differential equation is very similar to the task of solving difference equations which is useful elsewhere in time series analysis. It also gives a chance to review complex numbers. Let's see how it is done.

\ei

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]

1. Look for solutions of the form $x(t)=e^{\lambda t}$. Substituting this into the differential equation [M10] we get
\begin{equation}
\lambda^2 e^{\lambda t} = -\omega^2 e^{\lambda t}.
\end{equation}

\vspace{1cm}

2. Canceling the term $e^{\lambda t}$, we see that this has two solutions, with
\begin{equation}
\lambda = \pm \omega i, \hspace{5mm} \mbox{ where } i=\sqrt{-1}.
\end{equation}

\vspace{3mm}

3. The linearity of the differential equation means that if $y_1(t)$ and $y_2(t)$ are two solutions, then $a y_1(t)+b y_2(t)$ is also a solution for any $a$ and $b$. So, the \myemph{general solution} to M10 is
\begin{equation}
\label{ar2:v1}
x(t) = a e^{i\omega t} + b e^{-i\omega t}.
\end{equation}
Here, $a$ and $b$ could be complex numbers.

\vspace{1cm}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}

4. We may suspect that $x(t) = a e^{i\omega t} + b e^{-i\omega t}$ is sinusoidal by recalling the identities
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sin-cos-identity}
\sin(\omega t) = \frac{1}{2i}\big(e^{i\omega t} - e^{-i\omega t}\big), 
\quad\quad 
\cos(\omega t) = \frac{1}{2}\big(e^{i\omega t} + e^{-i\omega t}\big).
\end{equation}

5.  Typically for physical systems we want $x(t)$ to be real, so we know that the complex part of (\ref{ar2:v1}) is zero. This requires $a = (A/2) e^{i\phi}$ and $b=-(A/2) e^{-i\phi}$ for real $A$ and $\phi$. The algebra to show this is not critical for this course, but is a good exercise if you enjoy it. The factor of $1/2$ is arbitrary. This gives
\begin{equation}
\label{ar2:v2}
x(t) = \frac{A}{2} \left( e^{i(\omega t+\phi)} - e^{-i(\omega t + \phi)} \right).
\end{equation}

\vspace{3mm}

6. Putting together  (\ref{ar2:v2}) and (\ref{eq:sin-cos-identity}) we get
\begin{equation}
x(t) = A \sin(\omega t + \phi),
\end{equation}
which explains why the factor of $1/2$ in (\ref{ar2:v2}) is convenient.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Frequency, amplitude and phase for $x(t) = A\sin(\omega t + \phi)$}
\bi
\item 
$\omega$ is called the \myemph{frequency}, and $\phi$ is called the \myemph{phase}.
\item Angle is usually measured in \myemph{radians}, so the units of $\omega$ are radians per unit time, and units of $\phi$ are radians.
\item The \myemph{period} is $2\pi/\omega$, the time for one cycle.
\item $A$ is called the \myemph{amplitude}.
\item The frequency of the oscillation is determined by $\omega$ in M10, but the amplitude and phase are unspecified constants which may be determined by initial conditions.
\item It may be convenient to rescale to \myemph{cycles per unit time},
\begin{equation}
 x(t) = A \sin\big( 2\pi(\omega^\prime t + \phi^\prime) \big)
 \end{equation}
 where $\omega^\prime = \omega/2\pi$, $\phi^\prime = \phi/2\pi$.
\ei
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]
\bi
\item A discrete time version of M10 is a deterministic linear difference equation, replacing $\frac{d^2}{dt^2}$ by the second difference operator, $\Delta^2 = (1-B)^2$. This corresponds to a deterministic model equation,
$$\eqspace \Delta^2 y_n = - \omega^2 y_n.$$

\item Adding white noise, and expanding out $\Delta^2 = (1-B)^2$, we get a stochastic model,

\eqvspace
  
\negListSpace [M11] $\displaystyle \hspace{15mm} Y_n = \frac{2Y_{n-1}}{1+\omega^2} - \frac{Y_{n-2}}{1+\omega^2}  + \epsilon_n$.
    
\eqvspace

\item Model M11 may be appropriate to describe systems that have semi-regular but somewhat erratic fluctuations, called \myemph{quasi-periodic} behavior. Such behavior is evident in business cycles or wild animal populations.

\ei
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]

We look at a simulation from M11 with $\omega=0.1$ and $\epsilon_n\sim \mathrm{\iid} \, N[0,1]$. From our exact solution to the deterministic skeleton, we expect that a typical period of the oscillations should be $2\pi/\omega \approx 60$.

\item Quasi-periodic fluctuations are \myemph{phase locked} when the random perturbations are not able to knock the oscillations away from being close to their initial phase.

\item Eventually, the randomness should mean that the process is equally likely to have any phase, regardless of the initial phase.

What is the timescale on which the simulated model shows phase locked behavior? 
Equivalently, on what timescale does the phase of the fluctuations lose memory of its initial phase?
