The report will be graded on the following categories, based on the [posted expectations](midterm_project/midterm_project_info.html).

1. Communicating your data analysis. [10 points]

    + 1A. Raising a question. You should explain some background to the data you chose, and give motivation for the reader to appreciate the purpose of your data analysis.
<br>
<span style="color: blue;">
[4] Unusually strong, an engaging introduction to an original question.
<br>
[3] coherent and well-written.
<br>
[2] too brief or too close to a single source.
<br>
[1] not carried out to Masters level expectations;
</span>

    + 1B. Reaching a conclusion. You should say what you have concluded about your question(s).
<br>
<span style="color: blue;">
[4] Clearly written conclusions; matches the results; contributes in the context of the motivation.
<br>
[3] coherent and well-written.
<br>
[2] too brief, or with a substantial logical flaw.
<br>
[1] not carried out to Masters level expectations.
</span>

    + 1C. Communication style. Material should be presented in a way that helps the reader to appreciate the contribution of the project. Code and computer output are included only if they are pertinent to the discussion. Usually, code remains in the source file, and numerical results are presented in tables or graphs or text, rather than raw computer output.
<br>
<span style="color: blue;">
[2] Consideration give to communication, attention give to axis labels and scales, decisions on when and whether to present code or raw computer output.
<br>
[1] Repeatedly breaks usual standards for effective communication
<br>
[0] Written substantially below Masters level expectations.
<br>
Since this item was not listed in the original list of expectations, it is being graded borrowing points from the methodology expectation, "Value the readerâ€™s time: you may lose points for including material that is of borderline relevance, or that is not adequately explained and motivated."
</span>

    + 1D. You will submit your source code, but you should not expect the reader to study it. If the reader has to study the source code, your report probably has not explained well enough what you were doing.
<br>
<span style="color: blue;">
These recommendations are considered as part of communication style, and/or scholarship, and are not allocated any points here.
</span>



2. Statistical methodology. [10 points]

    + 2A. Justify your choices for the statistical methodology.
<br>
<span style="color: blue;">
[3] All relevant methods covered in the course are appropriately applied; consideration is given to whether they are adequate for the task.
<br>
[2] A range of methods is applied, but appropriate methods are omitted; methods to explore limitations or weaknesses of models are not adequately explored.
<br>
[1] The range of methods demonstrated does not reach Masters level expectations. 
<br>
There are no points specifically for investigating methods not covered in the class, but considering alternative approaches can be an effective approach to assessing the strengths and limitations of the methods we do cover.
<br>
A question arises whether it is reasonable to expect a simulation study to complement the data analysis. This is one place where group size was considered. As group size increases, it is reasonable to expect a wider range of methods to be considered. For a single investigator, it is understood that simulation results may be beyond the scope of a  midterm project even if they would help to clarify the conclusions.
</span>

    + 2B. The models and methods you use should be fully explained, either by references or within your report.
<br>
<span style="color: blue;">
[4] The report is careful to define notation and explicitly write out central model(s); a reasonable balance between describing methods used and defering to references.
<br>
[3] High quality of presentation of models and methods, but with non-trivial room for improvement.
<br>
[2] Over-dependent on undefined notation, using computer code as mathematical notation, out-sourcing details to references, or failing to give a reasonably precise model definition.
<br>
[1] Technical description of methodology written substantially below Masters level expectations.
</span>

    + 2C. Correctness. Obviously, we aim to avoid errors in the math we present, our code, or the reasoning used to draw conclusions from results. Being self-critical and paying attention to detail can help here. 
<br>
<span style="color: blue;">
[3] A reasonably range of methods and results is correctly reported.
<br>
[2] A substantial error, multiple minor errors, or limited scope of project giving limited ability to asses this (a project that avoids details of models and methods cannot show accuracy in doing this).
<br>
[1] Accuracy substantially below expectations for Masters level, or very limited scope of project giving no ability to assess this.
<br>
[0] Multiple errors, some of which affect conclusions, without evidence of effort to assess plausibility of results.
<br>
Note: errors may have consequences for other grading categories as well.
</span>


    + 2D. Focus on a few, carefully explained and justified, figures, tables, statistics and hypothesis tests. You may want to try many things, but only write up evidence supporting how the data help you to get from your question to your conclusions. Value the reader's time: you may lose points for including material that is of borderline relevance, or that is not adequately explained and motivated.
<br>
<span style="color: blue;">
Credit for this is awarded in the communication category.
</span>


3. Scholarship. [10 points]

    + 3A. Your report should make references where appropriate. For a well-written report the citations should be clearly linked to the material. The reader should not have to do detective work to figure out what assertion is linked to what reference. When using a reference to point the reader to descriptions elsewhere, you should provide a brief summary in your own report to make it self-contained. 
<br>
<span style="color: blue;">
</span>
<span style="color: blue;">
[4] Citations and references carried out to a high standard; (a) references clearly linked to the assertion they support; (b) material summarized in the report so that the reader does not have to go to the reference to understand the main thread of the report; (c) a thoughtful range of references that put the project report in a broader context.
<br>
[3] Good use of references, with room for improvement in one of (a,b,c).
<br>
[2] A reasonable effort at careful citation, but with substantial room for improvement.
<br>
[1] Citation standards not meeting expectations for a Masters level midterm project.
<br>
Note: Writing a project involves assessing what can be taken for granted. When is it appropriate to use without explanation the notation from a textbook (by reference, without summarizing the definition) or the notes? A good report defines when appropriate. We do not expect to go back to the axioms of mathematics whenever we write a math statement! Projects should spend some reasonable amount of time defining things, strengthened by references that give extra details.
</span>

    + 3B. You should properly acknowledge any sources (people or documents or internet sites) that contributed to your project. You are welcome, and encouraged, to look at previous projects, linked from [the course website](../index.html). If you address a question related to a previous project, you should put your contribution in the context of the previous work and explain how your approach varies or extends the previous work. It is especially important that this is clearly explained: substantial points will be lost if the reader has to carry out detective work to figure out clearly the relationship to a previous project.
<br>
<span style="color: blue;">
[4] It is expected that the report is written to a high ethical standard, in which case you should get full credit for this.
<br>
[0-3] Mild violations of expectations for responsible scholarship (such as clearly attibuting a statement to a source, but failing to quote the material if it is copied verbatim) may be handled by reduced points for this section; major violations will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.
</span>
    
    + 3C. Credit between group members. Your report should explain clearly how work was divided among members of the subgroup. Usually, there should be a short section explaining how the group and subgroup operated. Even if you are in a subgroup of size 1, it is appropriate to include some mention of whether you obtained feedback from other group members. 
<br>
<span style="color: blue;">
[2] A reasonable explanation of a functional group operating procedure, where each individual makes at least one identified contribution while also collaborating as a team; usually automatically satisfied for a group of size 1.
<br>
[1] Some cause for concern with effective group operation.
<br>
[0] Missing statement, or evidence of a dysfunctional group. For a dysfunctional group, action may be taken to adjust scores to reflect individual contributions, but otherwise all members of a group receive the same score.
</span>
