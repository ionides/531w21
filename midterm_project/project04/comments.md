**Strengths**: Looking for climate change signals is a current concern. The studied relationship between acreage and climate has problematic interpretation, which is recognized in the project. 

**Points for consideration**:

1. Differenced corn and soy should not have a negative trend - this is a visual artifact from comparison with temperature.

2. "No clear seasonality" should be the case for annual data

3. The construction of the 0.0698 p-value is not clearly explained.

4. $\epsilon_n$ is missing from the equations for $Y_n$

5. Careful discussion of confounding is needed when considering any causal inferences between temperature and crop acreage.
