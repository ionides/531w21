**Strengths**: A clearly written project which identifies and tests a hypothesis of practical interest. 

**Points for consideration**:

1. Histogram of data is generally less informative than histogram of detrended data or residuals: it is the last of these for which normality helps model specification.

2. Typos:
    + $\epsilon\in$ should be $\epsilon\sim$
    + $\psi_p$ should be $\psi_q$.

3. Develop math notation rather than writing $xreg_2$.

4. Missing statement on contributions within the group, requested in the project description.
