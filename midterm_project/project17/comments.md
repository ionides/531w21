**Strengths**: An original analysis, making good use of linear time series methods.

**Points for consideration**:

1. "300 million residences of Detroit" should perhaps be 300 thousand?

2. Phase is reasonably stable at frequecies of substantial coherence, and can be interpreted in those regions.

3. Could look at cross-correlation after deseasonalizing: the seasonal relationships and non-seasonal relationships may have different information.

4. The interpretation of correlation between inflow and outflow as a measure of successful control is unclear.
