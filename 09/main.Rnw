\section{Introduction to business cycles and mortality}

\begin{frame}{Historical investigations linking business cycles to mortality}

\vspace{-2mm}

\bi

\item \myemph{Pro-cyclical} mortality occurs if death rates are statistically above trend when economic activity is above trend. An early report was \citet{ogburn22}.

\item  Procyclical mortality, if it exists, shows that a key measure of population health is worse in economic booms than in recessions.

\item Both the economy and life expectancy have grown over the last century. However, these phenomena have not always occurred simultaneously. For example, 1950--1980 saw rapid growth in life expectancy in India and China, combined with relatively slow economic growth. Improvement in life expectancy has slowed during their recent economic surges.


\item The link between economic growth and health improvement is controversial, since it has political implications. Economists and epidemiologists have argued both sides of this debate, using time series methods.

\ei

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Implications of pro-cyclical mortality}

\vspace{-1mm}

\bi

\item If our goal is population health and happiness, how much should our policies focus on gross domestic product (GDP) growth? 

    \item Evidence supporting the view that economic growth is the critical engine for other improvements in living conditions would make a moral argument in favor of economic growth.

    \item Evidence that there are other major factors involved in improving living conditions suggest that economic growth should be only one political consideration, among others.

\ei

\end{frame}

\section{Data}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{A time series of life expectancy in the USA}


<<read_data_e>>=
e_data <- read.table(file="life_expectancy_usa.csv",header=TRUE)
head(e_data,n=4)
@

\bi
\item \link{life_expectancy_usa.csv}{Data} are from the \link{https://www.mortality.org/hmd/USA/STATS/E0per.txt}{Human Mortality Database}.

\item \code{e0} is \myemph{life expectancy at birth (LEB)} for civilians, 

\item \code{e0F} and \code{e0M} are LEB for females and males, but we focus on \code{e0}.

\item LEB is an actuarial calculation based on a fictitious individual having mortality rates at each age matching census age-specific mortality rates for the current year.

\item LEB is a standard way to combine all the age-specific mortality rates into a single number.

\ei

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]

<<read_data_u>>=
u_data <- read.table(file="unadjusted_unemployment.csv",
  sep=",",header=TRUE)
head(u_data,4)
@

\bi

\item We consider unadjusted unemployment from Bureau of Labor Statistics.

\item Unemployment is just one component of the state of the economy. One could consider other measurements.

\item Write ${e_n}$ for life expectancy in year $t_n=1947+n$. 


\item Write ${u_n}$ for mean unemployment in year $t_n$.

\ei

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{A time plot of the raw data}

\vspace{-2mm}

<<clean_data>>=
t <- intersect(e_data$Year,u_data$Year)
e <- e_data$e0[e_data$Year %in% t]
u <- apply(u_data[u_data$Year %in% t, 2:13],1,mean)
@

\vspace{-10mm}

<<data_plots,fig.height=5,fig.width=6,out.width="8cm",echo=F>>=

@

\vspace{-10mm}

\bi

\item We are interested in changes over business cycle timescales, once trends have been removed. 

\ei

\end{frame}

\section{Detrending the data}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{The Hodrick-Prescott filter}

\bi
\item To extract the cyclical component, we use an econometric method: the \myemph{Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter} \citep{hodrick97}.


\item Specifically, for a time series $\data{y_{1:N}}$, the HP filter is the time series $\data{s_{1:N}}$ constructed as
\begin{equation}
\negListSpace \data{s_{1:N}} =  \argmin_{s_{1:N}}
  \left\{ 
    \sum^{N}_{n=1}\big(\data{y_n}-s_{n}\big)^2 + \lambda\sum^{N-1}_{n=2}\big(s_{n+1}-2s_{n}+s_{n-1}\big)^2 
  \right\}.\end{equation}

\item The HP filter is a \myemph{smoothing spline}. 
Later, we see it can also be viewed as a state space model.

\item A standard econometric choice of $\lambda$ for removing nonlinear trend, for extracting the business cycle component, in annual data is $\lambda=100$.

\item An R implementation of the Hodrick-Prescott filter is \code{hpfilter} in the R package \code{mFilter}.


\ei

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]

\bi

\item We use the Hodrick-Prescott filter to define the HP-detrended life expectancy, $e^{HP}_{1:N}$, and unemployment, $u^{HP}_{1:N}$.


\ei

<<hp>>=
library(mFilter)
e_hp <- hpfilter(e, freq=100,type="lambda",drift=F)$cycle
u_hp <- hpfilter(u, freq=100,type="lambda",drift=F)$cycle
@

\bi

\item Plotting two time series on a single graph is not always advisable, but here it is helpful.

\ei

<<hpplots-code,eval=F,echo=T>>=
plot(t,u_hp,type="l",xlab="",ylab="detrended unemployment")
par(new=TRUE)
plot(t,e_hp,col="red",type="l",axes=FALSE,xlab="",ylab="")
axis(side=4, col="red",col.ticks="red",col.axis="red")
mtext("detrended e0",side=4,col="red",line=3)
@

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]

<<hpplots,echo=F,eval=T, fig.width=7,fig.height=3,out.width="11cm">>=
par(mai=c(0.8,0.8,0.1,0.8))
<<hpplots-code>>
@
Detrended unemployment (black; left axis) and detrended life expectancy at birth (red; right axis).

\bi

\item Looking at this figure may suggest that detrended life expectancy and detrended unemployment cycle together. 

\item We make a formal statistical test to check our eyes are not deceiving us.

\ei

\end{frame}

\section{Hypothesis testing: regression with ARMA errors}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{A regression with ARMA errors model}


\vspace{-1mm}

\bi

\item We can investigate the dependence of $e^{HP}_{1:N}$ on  $u^{HP}_{1:N}$ using a regression with ARMA errors model,
\begin{equation} E^{HP}_n = \alpha + \beta u^{HP}_n + \epsilon_n,\end{equation}
where $\{\epsilon_n\}$ is a Gaussian ARMA process. 
We use an ARMA(1,0) model, as discussed in the supplementary analysis.

\ei

<<hp_b>>=
a0 <- arima(e_hp,xreg=u_hp,order=c(1,0,0))
@
\vspace{-2mm}

<<hp_b_summary,echo=F>>=
z1 <- a0$coef["u_hp"]
z2 <- sqrt(a0$var.coef["u_hp","u_hp"])
mysummary(a0,print.sigma=T,loglik=T,coef.label=T)
@


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]

\bi

\item The standard error (computed via observed Fisher information) gives a $z$-statistic of $\Sexpr{myround(z1,4)}/\Sexpr{myround(z2,4)} = \Sexpr{myround(z1/z2,2)}$ for the coefficient of detrended unemployment.

\item We can also compute a p-value from a likelihood ratio test,

\ei

<<lrt>>=
log_lik_ratio <- as.numeric(
   logLik(arima(e_hp,xreg=u_hp,order=c(1,0,0))) -
   logLik(arima(e_hp,order=c(1,0,0)))
)
LRT_pval <- 1-pchisq(2*log_lik_ratio,df=1)
@

\bi

\item This gives a p-value of \Sexpr{myround(LRT_pval,5)}.

\item We have clear statistical evidence for a positive association between detrended unemployment and detrended life expectancy.

\item For all observational studies, interpretation of association needs care.

\ei

\end{frame}

\section{Association and causation}

\begin{frame}{Association and causation}

\bi

\item We have been careful to talk about \myemph{association}, since observational data giving firm statistical evidence of an assocation between $X$ and $Y$ cannot readily distinguish between three possibilities:
\ei
\begin{enumerate}
  \item  $X$ causes $Y$.

  \item $Y$ causes $X$.

  \item Both $X$ and $Y$ are caused by a third variable $Z$ that is unmeasured or has been omitted from the analysis. In this case, $Z$ is called a \myemph{confounding variable}.
\end{enumerate}
\bi
\item Here, it is not considered plausible that mortality fluctations drive economic fluctuations (the \myemph{reverse causation} possibility).

\item Unemployment is a \myemph{proxy variable} for economic fluctuations. Increased unemployment itself is necessarily directly causing reduced mortality: all proxy variables for economic activity are confounded in this analysis.

\ei

\end{frame}

\section{Looking for dependence in bivariate time series}

\subsection{Cross-correlation}

\begin{frame}{Potential lagged relationships}

\bi

\item A potential confounding variable is lagged economic activity. 
Theoretically, reduction in mortality for an current economic down-turn could result from delayed health progress caused by the previous economic boom.

\item A lag relationship between two time series $x_{1:N}$ and $y_{1:N}$ can be identified from the \myemph{sample cross-correlation function (CCF)}
\begin{equation}
\hat\rho_{xy}(h) =
  \frac{\sum_{n=1}^{N-h} (x_{n+h}-\bar x)(y_{n}-\bar y)}{\sqrt{\sum_{n=1}^{N} (x_{n}-\bar x)^2 \sum_{n=1}^N (y_{n}-\bar y)^2}}
\end{equation}

\item $\hat\rho_{xy}(h)$ estimates $\rho_{XY}(h)=\mathrm{Cor}\big(X_{n+h},Y_n\big)$, the cross-correlation at lag $h$ for a \myemph{bivariate stationary time series model}, consisting of a pair of random variables $\big(X_n,Y_n\big)$ at each time $n$.

\ei

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]

<<ccf_code,eval=F,echo=T>>=
ccf(e_hp,u_hp)
@

\vspace{-2mm}

<<ccf_eval,eval=T,echo=F,fig.width=7,fig.height=3.5,out.width="10cm">>=
par(mai=c(0.8,0.8,0.8,0.1))
<<ccf_code>>
@

\bi
\item The strong positive cross-correlation at lag zero supports pro-cyclical mortality.

\item The oscillatory pattern is not significant pointwise but might be more evident in the frequency domain.

\ei

\end{frame}

\subsection{The cross-spectrum, coherence and phase}

\begin{frame}{Cross-covariance and the cross-spectrum}
\bi
\item The \myemph{cross-covariance function} of a stationary bivariate time series model, $\big(X_n,Y_n\big)$, is
\begin{equation}
\gamma_{XY}(h)=\mathrm{Cov}\big(X_{n+h},Y_n\big).
\end{equation}

\item The \myemph{cross-spectrum} is the Fourier transform of the cross-covariance,
\begin{equation}
\lambda_{XY}(\omega) = \sum_{h=-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-2\pi i \omega h} \gamma_{XY}(h).
\end{equation}

\item The cross-spectrum can be estimated by smoothing the bivariate periodogram, using \code{spectrum} in {\Rlanguage}.

\ei

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Coherency, coherence and phase}

\bi
\item The \myemph{coherency} is the normalized cross-spectrum,
\begin{equation}
\rho_{XY}(\omega)= \frac{\lambda_{XY}(\omega)}{\sqrt{\lambda_{XX}(\omega)\, \lambda_{YY}(\omega)}}.
\end{equation}

\item Coherency measures correlation between frequency components of two time series at each frequency $\omega$. It is complex-valued.

\item The magnitude of the coherency is called the \myemph{coherence}. It measures whether a large amplitude at frequency $\omega$ for $x_{1:N}$ is associated with a large amplitude at $\omega$ for $y_{1:N}$.

\item The angle of the coherency (in the complex plane) is called the \myemph{phase}. A phase of $0$ means that peaks at frequency $\omega$ tend to occur simultaneously for $x_{1:N}$ and $y_{1:N}$. A phase of $\pm\pi$ at frequency $\omega$ means that peaks for the frequency component of $x_{1:N}$ coincide with troughs for $y_{1:N}$

\item The coherence and phase are estimated is estimated from the smoothed cross-periodogram and marginal periodograms.

\begin{frame}{Conclusions}

\bi
\item There is strong evidence of pro-cyclical mortality at a national level in the USA from 1948 to 2018. For example, the Great Recession of 2009-2010 led to high unemployment, but these two years had above-trend values of life expectancy at birth.

\item We have argued that this evidence supports a claim that above-trend economic growth CAUSES above-trend mortality.

\item We CANNOT infer that unemployment reduces mortality for those who lose their jobs. Adverse individual-level effects of unemployment can be reconciled with our result \citep{tapia14}.

\item More data might give statistical precision to investigate sub-populations more accurately than can be done with a national-level dataset. For example, \myemph{panel data analysis} combining time series for each state \citep{ionides13-aoas}.

\section{Supplementary analysis}

\subsection{Model selection by AIC}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Explaining the choice of an ARMA(1,0) error model}

\bi
\item Model selection by AIC for regression with ARMA errors follows the same approach as for ARMA models.
\ei

<<aic_table_code,echo=T,eval=F>>=
aic_table <- function(data,P,Q,xreg=NULL){
  table <- matrix(NA,(P+1),(Q+1))
  for(p in 0:P) {
    for(q in 0:Q) {
       table[p+1,q+1] <- arima(data,order=c(p,0,q),xreg=xreg)$aic
    }
  }
  dimnames(table) <- list(paste("AR",0:P, sep=""),
    paste("MA",0:Q,sep=""))
  table
}
e_aic_table <- aic_table(e_hp,4,5,xreg=u_hp)
require(knitr)
kable(e_aic_table,digits=2)
@

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]

<<aic_table_eval,echo=F,eval=T>>=
<<aic_table_code>>
@

\vspace{1mm}

\bi

\item ARMA(1,0) gives the best AIC among small models.

\item Some larger models have better AIC, but notice inconsistencies in the AIC table.  For example, consider ARMA(3,1) errors:

\ei

<<arma31>>=
a3 <- arima(e_hp,xreg=u_hp,order=c(3,0,1))
@

\vspace{-2mm}

<<arma31_summary,echo=F>>=
mysummary(a3,print.sigma=T,loglik=T,coef.label=F)
@

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]

\bi

\item The estimated ARMA(3,1) is at the boundary of invertiblity, with an MA1 coefficient on the unit circle.

\item This is reminiscent of our earlier analysis of the Lake Huron depth data.

\item Likely the ARMA(3,1) analysis is not very stable. A simulation study might find that the Fisher confidence intervals are not reliable.

\ei

\end{frame}


\subsection{Consistency through time}

\begin{frame}[fragile]

\bi

\item A useful relationship should be consistent through time. We check this by repeating the analysis on temporal subsets.

\ei

<<hp_t1>>=
t1 <- 1:35 
a1 <- arima(e_hp[t1],xreg=u_hp[t1],order=c(1,0,0))
@

\vspace{-2mm}

<<hp_t1_summary,echo=F>>=
mysummary(a1,print.sigma=F,loglik=F,coef.label=F)
@

<<hp_t2>>=
t2 <- 37:71
a2 <- arima(e_hp[t2],xreg=u_hp[t2],order=c(1,0,0))
@

\vspace{-2mm}

<<hp_t2_summary,echo=F>>=
mysummary(a2,print.sigma=F,loglik=F,coef.label=F)
@

\bi

\item The difference is small compared to the standard error. Overall there is consistency through this 71 year interval, though the pattern is weak in the 1990s.

\ei

\end{frame}

\subsection{Residual analysis}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Residual analysis}

\vspace{-2mm}

\bi

\item We inspect the residuals for the fitted model, and look at their sample autocorrelation.

\ei

<<resid_code,eval=F,echo=T>>=
r <- resid(arima(e_hp,xreg=u_hp,order=c(1,0,0)))
plot(r)
@

<<resid_eval,eval=T,echo=F,out.width="9cm",fig.width=7,fig.height=3>>=
par(mai=c(0.5,0.8,0.1,0.1))
<<resid_code>>
@


\bi

\item There is some evidence for fluctuations decreasing in amplitude over time. This is an example of \myemph{heteroskedasticity}. It is not extreme here, but could be studied in a future analysis.

\ei

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]

\vspace{-2mm}

<<acf_code,eval=F,echo=T>>=
acf(r)
@

\vspace{-1mm}

<<acf_eval,eval=T,echo=F,out.width="9cm",fig.width=5,fig.height=2.5>>=
par(mai=c(0.8,0.8,0.1,0.1))
<<acf_code>>
@

\bi

\item It is not a major model violation to have one out of 18 lags narrowly outside the dashed lines showing pointwise acceptance regions at the 5\% level under a null hypothesis of Gaussian white noise.

\item The presence of some small amount of sample autocorrelation is consistent with the AIC table, which finds the possibility of gains by fitting larger models to the regression errors.

\ei

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Analysis of temporal differences}

\bi

\item One might model annual changes in life expectancy, rather than difference from a trend. In this case, we consider the variable 
\begin{equation}
\Delta {e_n} = {e_n} - {e_{n-1}},
\end{equation}
computed as
<<clean_data_again>>=
delta_e <- e - e_data$e0[e_data$Year %in% (t-1)]
@

\ei

<<plot_diff,echo=F,fig.height=3,fig.width=7,out.width="11cm">>=
par(mai=c(0.5,0.8,0.2,0.8))
plot(t,u_hp,type="l",xlab="",ylab="detrended unemployment")
par(new=TRUE)
plot(t,delta_e,col="red",type="l",axes=FALSE,xlab="",ylab="")
axis(side=4, col="red",col.ticks="red",col.axis="red")
mtext("differenced e0",side=4,col="red",line=3)
@


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]

\bi

\item The relationship between unemployment and differenced life expectancy is harder to see than when HP-detrended.

\item The relationship is also harder to find by statistical methods:

\ei

<<arma_diff>>=
a4 <- arima(delta_e,xreg=u_hp,order=c(1,0,1))
@

\vspace{-2mm}

<<arma_diff_summary,echo=F>>=
z4.1 <- a4$coef["u_hp"]
z4.2 <- sqrt(a4$var.coef["u_hp","u_hp"])
mysummary(a4,print.sigma=T,loglik=T,coef.label=F)
@

\bi
\item Temporal differencing $z$-statistic of $\Sexpr{myround(z4.1,4)}/\Sexpr{myround(z4.2,4)} = \Sexpr{myround(z4.1/z4.2,2)}$ which is weaker evidence than the $z$-statistic of $\Sexpr{myround(z1/z2,2)}$ for HP-detrended LEB.

\ei

\end{frame}

\subsection{Multiple testing}

\begin{frame}{Multiple testing considerations}

\bi

\item A scientific principle for interpreting experimental results is as follows: \myemph{An experiment which finds evidence of an effect is usually a better foundation for future investigations than one which fails to find evidence.}

\item The experiment which found no evidence of an effect might have been a bad choice of experiment, or might have been carried out poorly. 

\item The principle of preference for methods giving positive results must be balanced with consideration of \myemph{multiple testing}.  If we make 20 hypothesis tests, we expect one to be significant at the 5\% level just by chance. There is a danger in trying many approaches and settling on one that claims statistical significance.

\item The generalizability of any result is tentative until confirmed in other studies.
