\section{Smoothing a time series}
%\subsection{}

\begin{frame}{Introduction to smoothing in time series analysis}



\bi
\item   Estimating a nonparametric trend from a time series is known as smoothing. We will review some standard smoothing methods.

\item We also smooth the periodogram to estimate a spectral density.

\item Smoothers have convenient interpretation in the frequency domain. A smoother typically shrinks high frequency components and preserves low frequency components.

\begin{frame}[fragile]

\frametitle{A motivating example}
\bi
\item The economy fluctuates between periods of rapid expansion and periods of slower growth or contraction. 

\item High unemployment is one of the most visible signs of a dysfunctional economy, in which labor is under-utilized, leading to hardships for many individuals and communities.

\item Economists, politicians, businesspeople and the general public therefore have an interest in understanding fluctuations in unemployment.

\item Economists try to distinguish between fundamental structural changes in the economy and the shorter-term cyclical booms and busts that appear to be a natural part of capitalist business activity.

\item Monthly US unemployment figures are published by the \link{https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNU04000000}{Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)}.

\item Measuring unemployment has subtleties, but these are not our immediate focus.

\item We see seasonal variation, and perhaps we see business cycles on top of a slower trend.

\item The seasonal variation looks like an additive effect, say an annual fluctation with amplitude around 1 percentage point.

\item Note: For a report, we should add units to plots. Extra details (like \code{bandwith} in the periodogram plot) should be explained or removed.

\subsection{The frequency response function of a smoother}

\begin{frame}{The frequency response function}

\vspace{-2mm}

\bi
\item The ratio of the periodograms of the smoothed and unsmoothed time series is the \myemph{frequency response} of the smoother.

\item The frequency response function tells us how much the smoother contracts (or inflates) the sine and cosine components at each frequency $\omega$.

\item A frequency response may involve change in phase as well as magnitude, but here we consider only magnitude.

\item Linear, time invariant transformations do not move power between frequencies, so they are characterized by their frequency response function.

\item Smoothers are linear and time invariant, at least approximately. If we scale or shift the data, we expect the smoothed estimate to have the same scale or shift. We expect a smooth approximation to the sum of two time series to be approximately the sum of the two smoothed series.

\ei

\section{Loess smoothing}

\begin{frame}[fragile]

\frametitle{Estimating trend by Loess smoothing}

\bi

\item Loess is a \myemph{Local linear regression} approach (perhaps an acronym for LOcal Estimation by Smoothing) also known as \myemph{Lowess} (perhaps LOcallyWEighted Sum of Squares). 

\item At each point in time, Loess computes a linear regression (a constant, linear or quadratic trend estimate) using only neighboring times. 

\item We can imagine a moving window of points included in the regression.

\item \code{loess} is an R implementation, with the fraction of points included in the moving window being scaled by the \code{span} argument. 

\item We can choose a value of the span that visually separates long term trend from business cycle.

\ei

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{A Loess smooth of unemployment}

<<loess_code,echo=T,eval=F>>=
u1_loess <- loess(u1~date,span=0.5)
plot(date,u1,type="l",col="red")

\frametitle{Extracting business cycles: A band pass filter}

\bi

\item For the unemployment data, high frequency variation might be considered ``noise'' and low frequency variation might be considered trend.

\item A band of mid-range frequencies might be considered to correspond to the business cycle.

\item We build a smoothing operation in the time domain to extract business cycles, and then look at its frequency response function.

\frametitle{Common smoothers in R}

\bi

\item Above, we have used the \myemph{local regression smoother} \code{loess} but there are other similar options.

\item \code{ksmooth} is a \myemph{kernel smoother}. The default periodogram smoother in \code{spectrum} is also a kernel smoother. See \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_smoother}

\item \code{smooth.spline} is a \myemph{spline smoother}.
\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothing_spline}

\item You can learn about alternative smoothers, and try them out if you like, but \code{loess} is a good practical choice for many smoothing applications.

\ei
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Bandwidth for a smoother}
\bi
\item All these smoothers have some concept of a \myemph{bandwidth}, which is a measure of the size of the neighborhood of time points in which data affect the smoothed value at a particular time point. 

\item The concept of bandwidth is most obvious for kernel smoothers, but exists for other smoothers.

\item We usually only interpret bandwidth up to a constant. For a particular smoothing algorithm and software implementation, you learn by experience to interpret the comparative value. Smaller bandwidth means less smoothing. 

\item Typically, when writing reports, it makes sense to focus on the tuning parameter for the smoother in question, which is not the bandwidth unless you are going kernel smoothing.

\item Section~2.3 of \citet{shumway17} discusses smoothing of time series, in the time domain.

\item Section~4.2 of \citet{shumway17} presents a frequency response function for linear filters, related to this chapter but in a different context.
