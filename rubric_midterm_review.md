The peer reviews were graded together, out of 10 points

[10]. A+ level. Excellent. One or more insightful comments, in an otherwise careful review. (Of 37 students, 8 received 10 which is more than I anticipate A+ grades.)

[9]. A level. A careful review, correctly identifying some strengths and weaknesses.

[8]. A- level. Thoughtful comments, but with limitations. Perhaps inadequate attention was paid to technical detail (or, less commonly, attention given too much to technical detail at the expense of a broader view).

[7]. B+ level. Satisfactory, but superficial (missing multiple issues).

No students received less than 7.
