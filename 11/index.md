We are borrowing material from a short course on [Simulation-Based Inference for Epidemiological Dynamics](https://kingaa.github.io/sbied/) (SBIED).
This short course uses the same notation as STATS/DATASCI 531 and shares an emphasis on likelihood methods for inference.
Indeed, SBIED can be viewed as a sub-course within STATS/DATASCI 531.
Although SBIED focuses on epidemiological examples, you can check from previous final projects for [2016](http://ionides.github.io/531w16/final_project/), [2018](http://ionides.github.io/531w18/final_project/) and [2020](http://ionides.github.io/531w20/final_project/) that the ideas extend readily to a variety of other situations.
Later, in Chapter 16, we will consider models for financial markets, which is another major area of application for nonlinear time series techniques. 


Chapter 11 is Lecture 1 of SBIED.

* Part 1. Time series analysis and mechanistic models in ecology and epidemiology.

* Part 2. Introduction to POMP models. This part has overlap with Chapter 10. It may be no bad thing to see the foundational material again, from a slightly different perspective. You are welcome to watch at 1.5 x speed if you are already comfortable with Chapter 10.

* Part 3. Introduction to the pomp R package for POMP models.
