**Strengths**: Developing a mechanistic model extending the SIR framework to fit multiple waves of COVID is not so easy, and this project makes good progress on that. The over-dispersed measurement model combined with the time-varying transmission rate is sufficient to obtain a model that is competitive with an ARMA benchmark comparison.

**Points for consideration**:

1. It is a reasonable assessment that the strong weekly pattern may be the missing piece for getting a mechanistic model to beat an ARMA benchmark.

2. Over-dispersed process noise might also help with this.

3. A time-varying measurement model would also make sense in the context of COVID.

4. These suggestions go beyond expectations for a final project: this is a nicely worked project that makes substantial progress toward its goal.
